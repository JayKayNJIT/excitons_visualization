# excitions_visualization
Automate the excitons visualization by using code Exciton through bash script


This script follows a tutorial[1] provided by the official tutorial library of the full potential all electron DFT code Exciting[2].
We will start from a home directory for the job. The home directory will contain directory files/ 1/  ....  X/ . 
Where X is number of systems/structures that you want to plot the excitons for. 
In this example we are considering X=4 so in our job home directory, we have directories as follows: files/ 1/  2/  3/  4/ . 
You can use these X/ directories to perform the SCF calculations[3] of all the systems, although it's not mandatory for this script, you can use any other directories to perform SCF calculations. Question: Why we need SCF calculations? Answer: We need to prepare the input files for the excitons calculation by looking at the output files generated by the SCF run i.e. finding states numbers corresponding to HOMO and LUMO and then using them in next step. Next step: prepare two input files, 1st as X.BSE.xml and 2nd as X.EXCITONS.xml, where X is same as described above. Since in our case X = 4, so our files/ will look like below:

1.BSE.xml            1.EXCITONS.xml       2.BSE.xml           2.EXCITONS.xml      3.BSE.xml            3.EXCITONS.xml     4.BSE.xml            4.EXCITONS.xml

X.BSE.xml is prepared by following Step 2 and X.EXCITONS.xml is prepared by using Step 3 of the tutorial[1]. Now create a new file JOB.sb in files/ which will be same job schedule file JOB.sb given in this repository and submit it to your machine. This script is desgined along with the input files to handle 4 systems and plot first 5 bright excitons(Y=5) of the each of those systems in real space[4] and k-space[5]. And this will also plot macroscopic dielectric function[6].
